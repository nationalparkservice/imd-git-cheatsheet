# Setting up Rstudio to talk with git

## 1. Make sure you have all the software and accounts you will need:

-   Download Git from the Software Center
-   Download R from the software Center
-   Download Rstudio from the software Center
-   Register an account at github.com

## 2. Configure git

You really should only have to do this once! From within Rstudio, access the "Terminal" pain and run the following code:

```         
git config --global user.name ‘your_github_username’
git config --global user.email ‘email_assoc_with_your_github_account'
git config --global --list
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

## 3. Configure Git with Rstudio

If you get API rate limit errors or your PAT expires, you may need to generate a new one. You may end up doing this multiple times but can generally skip it unless you run into errors or need to reset your credentials:

From with Rstudio's "Console" pane, run the following code:

If you don't already have it, install usethis and credentials for R:

```         
install.packages(c("usethis", "credentials")
```

create a personal access token for authentication:

```{r, create_PAT, eval=FALSE}
usethis::create_github_token()
```

running create_github_token() should open up a web browser and go to github.com. You may be asked to verify your account, enter a password, or otherwise link to the github ecosystem. Check for pop-ups on your second-monitor, if you have one!

From github.com, enter a description for your Personal Access Token (PAT) and select any options you might want; typically the default options work well for everything.

Don't forget to copy the PAT to your clipboard - you'll need it for the next step.

From within R, set your personal access token:

```         
credentials::set_github_pat("YourPAT")
```

# 4. Restart R!

You should be all set!
